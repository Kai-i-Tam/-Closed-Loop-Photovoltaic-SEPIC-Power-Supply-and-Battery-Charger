  ## Project Description
  This is one of the lab projects done in my MSEE class. One of my favourites. Have the chance to calculate, modeling, build, test the circuit.

  ## Pros
  Get the vertical design experience of Solar Power Converter
  
  ## Cons
  Never got a chance to actually design the PCB based on what I have done on the prototype.
    
  ## Note to Future Development
  If I will do the PCB of this projects, some of the measurement would be better because it would be less ESR and ESL.
  It would be nice to sell it as a kit for future students.
